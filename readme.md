Welcome to this programming language, which we'll call "Obfuscate". Obfuscate is a minimalistic language designed for fun and experimentation, with a strong emphasis on code obfuscation. The language features a set of simple, yet powerful commands that can be used to perform a wide range of operations. The language is stack-based, meaning that data is stored on a stack, and commands manipulate the stack by pushing or popping values.
Obfuscate has a relatively small set of commands, each represented by a single character. However, the language is designed to be highly obfuscated, with commands using seemingly random characters that make the code difficult to read and understand.
Obfuscate is not designed to be a practical language for everyday use, but rather as a fun and challenging language to experiment with. It's perfect for coding challenges or for exploring different programming concepts in a new and unusual way. So if you're looking for a language that will push your programming skills to the limit, then Obfuscate might be just what you're looking for!

All commands can be found in the commands.txt file
